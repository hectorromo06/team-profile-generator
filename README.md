## Description
With this application a manager can quickly generate a team roster webpage through CLI 
## Purpose
Generate a webpage with the team's basic information to have quick access to names, employee IDs, emails, office numbers, GitHub profiles, and schoool names
## Process
1. Using Test Driven Development I first created tests for my object classes
2. I then created the Manager, Intern, and Engineer objects which extend the Employee object class
3. Once the tests pass, I then created an HTML template of what the page should look like
4. Upon completing the template it was fairly easy to manipulate it with user input from CLI inquirer prompts
5. Finally, the HTML is generated after the user inputs the responses and the stylesheet is also copied to the dist directory
